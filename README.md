Imdone is text based kanban processor with a simple syntax that uses [comment tags like TODO and FIXME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_%28computer_programming%29#Tags) and [todo.txt format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt#todotxt-format). This model allows the user to create and modify tasks using the keyboard and automatically establishes a link between their tasks and work.  Get [imdone-atom](https://atom.io/packages/imdone-atom) for [Atom editor](https://atom.io) to see your projects board and this library in action.

## Imdone format
Imdone aims to keep you in the flow of your work while capturing tasks to be accomplished later.  Most kanban tools require the user to use a UI.  Imdone lets you capture tasks in a simple text format that has roots in programming [comment tags like TODO and FIXME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_%28computer_programming%29#Tags) and [todo.txt format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt#todotxt-format).

### Code Style
<pre>
// TODO This is a task
// TODO: This is a task
// TODO:5 This is a task
// TODO: A task with a descrption looks like this.
// Every line after the task is part of the description until we find another
// task, a blank comment line, or a line of code
// - A list item
// - Another list item
</pre>

### Hash Style
<pre>
&#35;TODO: This is a task
&#35;TODO:0 This is a task
&#35;to-do:0 This is a task

&lt;!--
&#35;TODO: If you don't want your task to get converted to html in markdown files, put it in a comment.
You can still add descriptive text, but don't forget to leave a blank line
between the description and the comment end tag, or the comment end will become
a part of your description.

 --&gt;
</pre>

Take a look at the source of this README.md.  You'll probably find a few tasks in comments.

### Markdown Style
<pre>
&#91;This is a task&#93;&#40;&#35;todo:&#41;
&#91;This is a task&#93;&#40;&#35;todo:10&#41;
</pre>

### Task syntax
- Code style tasks will only be detected if the list name matches a string in the `code.include_lists` attribute in `.imdone/config.json` and the file extension exists in lib/languages.js.
- List names in code style tasks must match this regular expression ([A-Z]+[A-Z-_]+?).
- In Hash and markdown style tasks **list name** can be any combination of upper and lower case letters, underscores and dashes
- In Hash and markdown style tasks the **list name** must be followed by a `:` and a number which determines sort order in the list
  - Sort numbers can be reused, in which case tasks with the same sort number will be sorted alphabetically by text.
- In code, tasks can be any style but must be in a line or block comment
  - Code style tasks are only detected in comments for files with extensions listed in [imdone-core/languages.js](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core/blob/master/lib/languages.js) or the **languages** attribute in the `.imdone/config.json`
- For code and hash style tasks, the task text is terminated by the end of line
- Task text can have [todo.txt formatting](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) excluding the completion and priority markers.
- Task text can have markdown formatting

<!--  DOING: Add a section about descriptions
### Task Descriptions
Task descriptions are captured from the lines that follow a task.  In code files a description ends when imdone encounters another task or code.  In non-code files the description ends when imdone encounters another task or a blank line.
-->

### todo.txt syntax examples
Imdone uses todo.txt +project/tag @context and meta:data

#### Create date
<pre>
&#35;DOING:20 This task was created on 2018-02-09 created:2018-02-09
</pre>

#### Completed date
<pre>
&#35;DOING:20 This task was completed on 2018-02-09 completed:2018-02-09
</pre>

#### Due Date
<pre>
&#35;doing:20 This task is due on 2015-02-09 due:2015-02-09
</pre>

#### Tags (todo.txt projects)
<pre>
&#35;doing:20 This task has a &#42;madjs&#42; tag +madjs
</pre>

#### Context
<pre>
&#35;doing:20 This task has a &#42;madjs&#42; context @madjs
</pre>

#### Metadata
<pre>
&#35;doing:20 This task has profile metadata profile:piascikj
</pre>

##### Metadata links
- Tasks with metadata can be linked to external resources like other task mgmt systems and websites
- Add a `meta` attribute to `.imdone/config.json`
- In this example `user:piascikj` would link to <https://github.com/piascikj>  

```javascript
  "meta": {
    "user": {
      "urlTemplate": "https://github.com/%s",
      "titleTemplate": "github profile for %s"
    }
  }
```
