# My notes

This is the test file for long cards

## [A card with preserved blank lines](#DOING:0)
<card>
We like to write with space.

Sometimes we don't.

- [ ] We can have lists
- [ ] like this

```md
and code blocks
```

<!--
comments are okay too
#urgent/now
--->

</card>

## #TODO:0 A task without blank lines
- no blank lines here
- but we'll have some soon
