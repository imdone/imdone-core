# #DONE Plan a story

As a developer I would like to plan a story and make it visible by adding tasks to a story markdown in my repo

## Tasks

- [x] Set default branch (Ask on init)
- [x] Set working remote (Ask on init)
- [x] Rename `import` to `plan`
- [x] Implement git automation
  1.  Fetch from working remote
  2.  Checkout default branch
  3.  Checkout or create story branch
  4.  If it's not a git repo ask to init
- [x] Add the story project
- [x] Move the story task to DOING
- [ ] Commit and push the story branch with force

## Later Stories

### Convert a card with tasks to a story and tasks
  - [ ] `task.text` is storyId if `story-id` meta is not set
  - [ ] First paragraph is story content
  - [ ] Process tasks in the same way as command line

### When we ask for tasks automatically add the DoD, so the user can delete ones that aren't relevant
  - [ ] Ask for story id
  - [ ] Ask for story description
  - [ ] Ask for tasks with inquirer 

### Generate task list in a tasks README: `backlog/stories/<story-id>/tasks/README.md`
  - Put a comment at the top of the file that say's it's autogenerated
  - Each task should have a relative path link back to task file it came from
