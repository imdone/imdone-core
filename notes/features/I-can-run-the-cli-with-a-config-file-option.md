Run with a config option, so the config can be synced with git and jira plugin can run in CI.

[Jira plugin :-) · Issue #26 · imdone/imdone-core](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core/issues/26)

## Outcome

When a plugin is configured in `.imdone/config.yml`, a `.imdone/.env` file exists and an imdone-with-jira board action is executed with the cli, it runs successfully.
