# #TODO Leave information about adding languages in the faq

- If code TODO comments are not showing up on your imdone board, add a languages entry in you imdone.yml file. For example:
```yaml
languages:
  .cs:
    name: cs
    symbol: "//"
    block:
      start: "/*"
      end: "*/"
      ignore: "*"
```
