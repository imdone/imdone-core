# imdone-header-footer-plugin

Add custom headers and footers to your imdone cards. Just add a **header** and/or **footer** in the plugin settings
and it will appear in all of your cards.

You can also use [interpolated values](https://imdone.io/docs/#/cards?id=string-interpolation) in your header and footer.
