## #TODO Plan a story
As a developer I would like to plan a story and make it visible by adding tasks to a story markdown in my repo
- [ ] Set default branch (Ask on init)
- [ ] Set working remote (Ask on init)
- [ ] Implement git automation
  1.  Fetch from working remote
  2.  Checkout default branch
  3.  Checkout or create story branch
- [ ] Add the story project
- [ ] When we as for tasks automatically add the DoD, so the user can delete ones that aren't relevant
- [ ] Generate task list in `backlog/stories/<story-id>/tasks/README.md`
  - Put a comment at the top of the file that say's it's autogenerated
- [ ] Commit and push the story branch with force
