# #DOING Plan a story
<card>

As a developer I would like to plan a story and make it visible by adding tasks to a story markdown in my repo

## Tasks

- [x] Set default branch (Ask on init)
- [x] Set working remote (Ask on init)
- [x] Rename `import` to `plan`
- [x] Implement git automation
  1.  Fetch from working remote
  2.  Checkout default branch
  3.  Checkout or create story branch
  4.  If it's not a git repo ask to init
- [x] Add the story project
- [x] Move the story task to DOING
- [ ] Commit and push the story branch with force

## Later Stories

### Convert a card with tasks to a story and tasks
  - [ ] `task.text` is storyId if `story-id` meta is not set
  - [ ] First paragraph is story content
  - [ ] Process tasks in the same way as command line

### When we ask for tasks automatically add the DoD, so the user can delete ones that aren't relevant
  - [ ] Ask for story id
  - [ ] Ask for story description
  - [ ] Ask for tasks with inquirer 

### Generate task list in a tasks README: `backlog/stories/<story-id>/tasks/README.md`
  - Put a comment at the top of the file that say's it's autogenerated
  - Each task should have a relative path link back to task file it came from

    commit
    branch story/123

    merge main
    branch story/123/tasks/a-task-on-story123
    checkout story/123/tasks/a-task-on-story123

```

## Plan a story flow
```mermaid

  start((Plan a story CLI))
    --> askForStoryId(Prompt for storyId)
    --> changesExist{Are there local changes?}
  
  startUI((Plan a story UI))
    --> changesExist{Are there local changes?}

  checkoutDefaultBranch(Checkout default branch)
    --> fetch(Fetch --all)
    --> pullDefaultBranch(Pull default branch with force)
    --> storyBranchExists{Does story branch exist?}

  mergeDefaultBranch(Merge default branch)
    --> createStoryProject(Create story project)
    --> moveStoryToDOING(Move story to DOING)
    --> promptForStoryTasks(Prompt for story tasks 'CLI only')
    --> addTaskFilesToStory(Add task and DoD files to story)
    --> addTasksAndDoDToReadme(Add imdone tasks and DoD in story project \n to `tasks/README.md` reporting file)
    --> commitAndPushStoryBranch(Commit and push story branch with force)

  changesExist
    -- yes --> 
      gitStash(Git stash)
      --> checkoutDefaultBranch
  changesExist
    -- no -->
      checkoutDefaultBranch

  storyBranchExists 
    -- yes -->
      checkoutStoryBranch(Checkout story branch)
      --> pullStoryBranch(Pull story branch with force)

## Convert a card with tasks to a story with tasks

- `task.text` becomes story title
  - if `story-id` meta is not set, the `task.text` is used as `story-id`
- First paragraph is story content
- Process tasks in the same way as command line
- Regenerate tasks from files in `tasks` every time one changes
- disable check in UI

```markdown
This is the story title

This is the story description

## Tasks

- [ ] Ungrouped task a
- [ ] Ungrouped task b
- [ ] Ungrouped task c

### Group 1

- [ ] Group 1 task a
- [ ] Group 1 task b
- [ ] Group 1 task c

### Group 2

- [ ] Group 2 task a
- [ ] Group 2 task b
- [ ] Group 2 task c

<!-- use title as story-id if it's falsy -->
